## Python Definition

 > **Python** is an **interpreted** *(executed line-by-line at run time by the Python interpreter)* **general purpose** or **multi-purpose** *(It can be used in multiple domains)* **high level** *(easily understood by humans)* programming language with **easy syntax** *(simpler compared to languages like C, C++, or Java)* and **dynamic semantics** *(variables are dynamic objects in Python, meaning you do not need to specify a variable's type when declaring it)*.

- Created by **Guido van Rossum**

- Developed between **1985 and 1990**
- Named after the British comedy series **_Monty Python's Flying Circus_**

## What is a Compiler?

> A **compiler** is a complex piece of software whose job is to convert **source code** (human-readable code like C) to **machine understandable code** or **binary code** **in one go** .

## What is an Interpreter?

> An interpreter is a software program written to translate source code to machine code, but it does that **line by line** .
It translates the code "on the fly," meaning at runtime .

## Compiled vs. Interpreted Languages

### Compiled Languages

| Advantage (Pros) | Disadvantage (Cons) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Private Code**  | **No Portability**  |
| Only the executable is provided, not the source code. | The generated executable is specific to the machine type it was compiled on (e.g., Windows executable runs on Windows only). |
| **Faster Execution**  | **Extra Compilation Step**  |
| Compilation happens once; the executable (in machine code) runs multiple times quickly. | Any change to the source code requires recompilation before running. |
| **Fully Optimized**  | |
| The executable is optimized for the CPU, leading to better performance. | |


### Interpreted Languages

| Advantage (Pros) | Disadvantage (Cons) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Portable**  | **Needs Interpreter**  |
| The source code is provided, which can run on any machine that has an interpreter installed. | The code must be provided to the interpreter every time it needs to be executed. |
| **Easy Debugging**  | **Slower**  |
| The interpreter translates line by line, generating an error immediately if an issue is found, making error checking easier. | The translation happens every time the code runs, making execution slower than an optimized executable. |
| | **Public Code**  |
| | The source code must be provided to the user, meaning your code is public. |
